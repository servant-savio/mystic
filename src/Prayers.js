        <h2>MORNING OFFERING</h2>
        <p>
        O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, 
        I offer you my prayers, works, joys and sufferings 
        of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred 
        Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass 
        throughout the world, in reparation for my sins, 
        for the intentions of all my relatives and friends 
        and in particular for the intentions of the Holy 
        Father. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>ACT OF FAITH</h2>
        <p>
          O my God, I firmly believe that you are one 
          God in three divine persons, Father, Son and 
          Holy Spirit; I believe that your divine Son 
          became man and died for our sins, and that 
          he shall come to judge the living and the 
          dead. I believe these and all the truths that 
          the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you 
          have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor 
          be deceived.
        </p>
        <h2>ACT OF HOPE</h2>
        <p>
          O my God, relying on your almighty power and 
          infinite mercy and promises, I hope to obtain 
          pardon for my sins, the help of your grace, 
          and life everlasting, through the merits of 
          Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer.
        </p>

        <h2>ACT OF CHARITY</h2>
        <p>
        O my God, I love you above all things, with my 
        whole heart and soul, because you are all-good and 
        worthy of all love. I love my neighbor as myself for 
        the love of you. I forgive all who have injured me, 
        and ask pardon of all whom I have injured.
        </p>
        <h2>PRAYER BEFORE A DAY'S WORK</h2>
        <p>
          Direct, we beg you, O Lord, our actions by your holy 
          inspirations, and carry them on by your gracious 
          assistance, that every prayer and work of ours may begin 
          always with you, and through you be happily, ended. 
          Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>
          PRAYER TO KEEP PRESENCE OF GOD
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lord, God Almighty, you have brought us safely to the 
          beginning of this day. Defend us today by your mighty 
          power, that we may not fall into any sin, but that all 
          our words may so proceed and all our thoughts and actions
          be so directed, as to be always just in your sight. 
          Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
        </p>

        <h2>
          ACCEPTANCE OF GOD'S WILL
        </h2>
        <p>
          In all things may the most holy, the most just, and 
          the most lovable will of God be done, praised, and exalted 
          above all for ever. Your will be done, O Lord, your will 
          be done. The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away; 
          blessed be the name of the Lord.
        </p>
        <h2>
          PRAYER FOR VOCATIONS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lord Jesus Christ, Shepherd of souls, who called the apostles 
          to be fishers of men, raise up new apostles in your holy 
          Church. Teach them that to serve you is to reign: to 
          possess you is to possess all things. Kindle in the young 
          hearts of our people the fire of zeal for souls. Make them 
          eager to spread your Kingdom upon earth. Grant them courage 
          to follow you, who are the Way, the Truth and the Life; who 
          lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>
          ACT OF CONTRITION
        </h2>
        <p>
          O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended you and 
          I detest all my sins, because I dread the loss of heaven 
          and the pains of hell; but most of all because they offend 
          you, my God, who are all good and deserving of all my love. 
          I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace, to confess 
          my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>
          PRAYER FOR THE POPE
        </h2>
        <p>
          May the Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him
          blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not to the will of his
          enemies. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>
          COME HOLY SPIRIT
        </h2>
        <p>
          Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and kindle in them the fire of your love. Send forth your Spirit and they shall be created. And You shall renew the face of the earth.
          O, God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit, did instruct the hearts of the faithful, grant that by the same Holy Spirit we may be truly wise and ever enjoy His consolations, Through Christ Our Lord, Amen.
        </p>

          Blessed are thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

          HAIL HOLY QUEEN
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, hail, our life, our 
          sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished 
          children of Eve: to thee do we send up our sighs, 
          mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, 
          most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, 
          and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed 
          fruit of thy womb, Jesus, O merciful, O loving, O 
          sweet Virgin Mary! Amen.
